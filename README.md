## General Notes

- The current plan is to develop the frontend and backend in their own folders as opposed to serving the frontend out of the express server from the build directory. This is so that we can take advantage of hot-reload developing.

## Lanuages and Frameworks

- Backend: Node.js + Express + mongoose
- Frontend: Node.js + React
- Databse: MongoDB

## Running List of Installed (or need to be installed) NPM Packages

- React Router (needs to be installed)
- React Bootstrap (needs to be installed)
- React Redux? (may need to be installed)

## Dev Environment Setup (INCOMPLETE, ask Jack)

1. Ensure you have NPM installed

    - On MacOS this can be accomplished with Homebrew.
    - Other OS please read NPM's documentation.

2. Type the following to setup frontend/

``` {bash}
cd frontend/
npm i --save
```

3. Ensure that NPM packages were properly installed.
